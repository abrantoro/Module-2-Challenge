# Module-2-Challenge VBA Scripting 
This is the script and screenshots from the Module 2 challenge 

The things I've learned in this challenge was the basic premise of coding along with how to extract, organize, and calculate large amounts of data via Microsoft Excel. Another aspect I learned aobut this course and bootcamp so far is time management. I took on this bootcamp too lightly and kept working absurd amount of hours through the week but have come to manage my time better and now keep up with class. The assignment is sent it in late which I apologize but I did want to try my best learning this tool and leaving this module behind understanding the convepts I learned.
